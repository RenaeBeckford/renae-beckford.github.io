                <td><p>Hey, this section on my website is dedicated to telling you, my viewer something about myself. I am about halfway to really knowing myself. It's a process like getting
                    to know another person, learning to be in tune with your honest thoughts and motives.
                    Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself, you would
                    expect after 20 years i would know myself well enough to know where to start, well , i'll try to see what type of image i can portray to you of me.
                    <br><br>
                    I am a person who is neutral about every aspect of life. I believe our traits whether positive or negative makes us the person we are portrayed to the world.
                    <br>
                    I like to keep a smile on my face no matter what I am going through, and that smile keeps me going.
                    As a person I believe life is an art and I am the artist of my life, I try to keep this art colourful and as positive and cheerful as possible.
                    <br>
                    There are many things I enjoy doing, Seeing and experiencing. For instance i enjoy music, 
                    <br>
                    music in my opinion is the best stress reliever, there is nothing a good song and a clear mind cannot fix. I also enjoy a good movie, I tend to live my life 
                    <br>
                    vicariously through these motion pictures.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, there are many other things I dislike but I tend to not know them off the top of my head until it appears in sight. Sometimes I get irritated by the slightest things
                    <br> 
                    Another time it's things that are worth the fuss. At the end of the day this is me and I dont see myself changing for anyone but me.
                    <br>
                    My favourite quote or thing to say is a lyric from the song Blessings by Big Sean ft. Drake, Kanye West, "Im here for a good time not a long time"
                    <br>
                    Because i'm a strong believer in living life to the fullest and living for others. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6t47RI4bns"> Click HERE if you want to hear the song. </a>

                    <br>
                    The Materialist values beauty, attractiveness foremost. They are more likely to be into fashion, fancy things (cars, houses, etc.). Personally I think that 30% is accurate 
                    <br>
                    it's not a very high value because

                    46% Offbeat - seeks to live on the vanguard of existence, to step into the unknown. What is the point of living a life that has already been lived before is the ethos of the Offbeat individual, to sacrifice

                    who you were, are, to become something new, different.

                    <br>
                    feels good or that something works, the Thinker needs a more rational understanding so they can achieve reliable results in life.

                    50% Interpersonal - are more about others than themselves and would rather hurt them-self than hurt another person. They don't help others to get something back, they help others because they are more wired to the 
                    <br>
                    needs of others than their own needs. They feel the hunger, pain, happiness in someone else more than in themself.

                    46% Vital - content, positive, high energy, life enjoying, optimistic, strong will to live, self motivated. Vitals believe happiness is something you have control over.

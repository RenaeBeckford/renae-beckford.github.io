            <p>Goal setting is deciding where you want to go and then designing a plan to get you there. 
                <br>
                Setting goals that stretch you and make you do things differently is what will lead you to a future that you want.  
                <br>
                Do not wait for people to set goals for you be the writer of your own book.
                <br>
                Build the life you see for yourself. As someone who is young, making goals for your life can create or open doors for 
                <br>
                you and create future opportunitites for me, even if the goal is small or big just starting is the step in the right direction.
                <br>
                <h4>Chapter 5 - The Proper Use of Time</h4>
                <p>We all must suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.  
                   <br>
                    The difference is that discipline weighs ounces and regret weights tons. Your best opportunity each day 
                    <br>
                    are those that align with your overall goals and should be what you spend your time on. Do not just go through the day, 
                    <br>
                    get from the day. Do not spend you time on urgent, spend your time on what is important. 
                    <br>
                    We must be our own designer of our lives.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Chapter 6 - Surround Yourself With the Best People</h4>
                    <p>Ask yourself these questions:  Who am I around?  What effect are they having on me? 
                        <br>
                        What have they got me reading? What have they got me saying? Where do they have me going? 
                        <br>
                        What do they have me thinking? And most importantly, what do they have me becoming? 
                        <br>
                        Then ask yourself the final question: is that okay?
                        <br>
                        Friends of convenience. This is an interesting concept.  
                        <br>
                        Is it easier to keep certain people for friends, instead of pursuing new friends. Successful 
                        <br>
                        people look for relationships with other successful people who will push them, challenge them, 
                        <br>
                        and encourage them to become better. To attract attractive people, you must be attractive.  Not physically but mentally and who you are.
                        <br>
                        Your attitude is greatly influenced by the people who you associate with.
                        <br>
                        My old principal would always tell her cohort to surround yourself with people who reflect who you are.
                        <br>
                        I have always pride myself with finding friends who represent who I am as a person.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Chapter 7 - Be a Life-Long Learner</h4>
                        <p>Self-education is what you teach yourself.  It is what you learn along the way so that you are 
                            <br>
                            constantly improving and growing. Most people do not continue to learn and grow, to separate yourself 
                            <br>
                            from everyone else, be focused on continuous learning. Learning is the beginning of wealth.  Learning is the beginning of health.  
                            <br>
                            Learning is the beginning of spirituality.  Searching and learning are where the miracle process all begins.
                            <br>
                            Always continue to build on your education, it is a key success criteria for a successful life.
